ok so i guess i should document this so im doing that
i coppied most of the config files from the 2025 post project, i dont know the information off the top of my head and if we already entered it whats the point of doing it twice, but i left 
the wheel offsets at 0 so i could tune them myself. i had one little hickup where i forgot to coppy a json file and SwerveDrive was having a miscarriage, but thats just a whoopsies. so i 
just made a very basic subsystem that holds the SwerveDrive and had a command called "test", wich constantly spat out the angles of whichever wheel i told it to. then i went one at a time 
moving the wheels to the angle i wanted to be 0 and coppying the angle it thought it was at into the modules offset. worked great, no fancy shmancy advatage whatever needed. then drive was
almost as simple as calling a function. i say almost because i had an issue where the P for the angles pid was set way to low, because kraken motors need super high Ps and people dont usually
use them for angle motors, so the angle motors didnt move and confused me, but once again just a configuration whoopsies. then the directions it moved in were wrong because joystic space and
robot space are very differnt. robot space is forward on +x, left on +y, and joystick space is forward on -y, left on -x. just use x for y and y for x, negate everything, and you should be 
good. x = -y and y = -x; and yeah now i get to be confused by the lack of documentation on how to get yagsl to follow a path, yippie!
